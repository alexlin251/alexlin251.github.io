I work as a Resident Assistant on the Busch campus, and I run the Rutgers Bioethics Society alongside a diverse team of student thinkers. In my spare time, I volunteer as an emergency medical technician for the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps. I am currently an Intern for The Bioethics Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \r\n\r\nWhen I am not dealing with residents, responding to medical emergencies, and tackling ethical dilemmas, I enjoy playing the guitar, jamming out at concerts, and exploring the road less traveled.\r\n\r\nAnd while I do all these things, I always follow my ABCs: **be ambitious, be benevolent, be curious!**\r\n                        \r\n### Rutgers Residence Life\r\n\r\nHello residents! Have questions about housing, policies, submitting a maintenance request etc? Swing by my room, or visit: http://ruoncampus.rutgers.edu/.   \r\n\r\nMy Resident Assistant Placements:\r\n\r\n-2016-17 : Thomas Suites, Busch Campus\r\n\r\n-2015-16 : Morrow Suites, Busch Campus\r\n\r\n**Think you have what it takes to be a Resident Assistant?! Need a letter of recommendation from an RA? Shoot me message, and I'll see if I can help you out! Please ask me at least 2 weeks before the letter is due.\r\n\r\n### What is Bioethics???\r\n\r\nAs members of the Bioethics Society of Rutgers University, we hope to generate campus-wide awareness of some of the most current and pressing ethical issues in science and medicine. We pursue topics of bioethics both within the Rutgers community and at large in national debate competitions. We combine theoretical discussion with real-world applications to examine the moral considerations of a wide variety of topics and their implications in society. As an organization, we work to achieve an open environment for students looking to voice their opinions and tackle the ever challenging questions of bioethics.\r\n\r\nWe meet twice per month in Scott Hall (43 College Avenue, New Brunswick, NJ 08901). Find us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/bioethics.ru. You can also join our mailing list by contacting the administrator at rubioethics.soc@gmail.com. \r\n\r\nCheck out our website at: http://eden.rutgers.edu/~bioeth/about.html\r\n\r\n### Potpourri\r\n\r\nI love listening to and talking about music. You can check out my old music blog here: http://tryingtotesselate.tumblr.com. Do let me know if you have any music recommendations! \r\n\r\nDuring the week, you can find me relaxing at the gym and getting lost in New York City.\r\n\r\n### Let's Talk!\r\n\r\nWant to check out my resume, transcript, etc?
