I work as a Resident Assistant on the Busch campus, and I run the Rutgers Bioethics Society along side a diverse team of student thinkers. In my spare time, I volunteer as an emergency medical technician for the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps. I am currently an Intern for The Bioethics Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \r\n\r\nWhen I am not dealing with residents, responding to medical emergencies, and tackling ethical dilemmas, I enjoy playing the guitar, attending concerts, and exploring the road less traveled.  \r\n\r\n### What is Bioethics???\r\n\r\nAs members of the Bioethics Society of Rutgers University, we hope to generate campus-wide awareness of some of the most current and pressing ethical issues in science and medicine. We pursue topics of bioethics both within the Rutgers community and at large in national debate competitions. We combine theoretical discussion with real-world applications to examine the moral considerations of a wide variety of topics and their implications in society. As an organization, we work to achieve an open environment for students looking to voice their opinions and tackle the ever challenging questions of bioethics.\r\n\r\nWe meet twice per month in Scott Hall (43 College Avenue, New Brunswick, NJ 08901). Find us on Facebook at www.facebook.com/bioethics.ru. You can also join our mailing list by contacting the adminstrator at rubioethics.soc@gmail.com. \r\n\r\nCheck out our website at: http://eden.rutgers.edu/~bioeth/about.html\r\n\r\n### Potpourri\r\n\r\nI love listening and talking about music. You can check out my old music blog here: http://tryingtotesselate.tumblr.com\r\n\r\nDuring the week, you can find me relaxing at the gym, trying not to get lost in New York City, and pondering ethical dilemmas. \r\n\r\n### Let's Talk!\r\n\r\nWant to check out my resume, transcript, etc? Just want to get to know me more? Have an ethical dilemma you want to share?\r\n\r\nYou can reach me at alexlin251@gmail.com\r\n\r\n",
