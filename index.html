<a id="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>Hello there! I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University-New Brunswick working towards a dual major in Biological Sciences and Philosophy. I work as a Resident Assistant on the Busch campus, and I run the Rutgers Bioethics Society alongside a diverse team of student thinkers. In my spare time, I volunteer as an emergency medical technician for the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps. I am currently an Intern for The Bioethics Program at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. </p>

<p>When I am not dealing with residents, responding to medical emergencies, and tackling ethical dilemmas, I enjoy playing the guitar, jamming out at concerts, and exploring the road less traveled.</p>

<p>And while I do all these things, I always follow my ABCs: <strong>be ambitious, be benevolent, be curious!</strong></p>

<p>As members of the Bioethics Society of Rutgers University, we hope to generate campus-wide awareness of some of the most current and pressing ethical issues in science and medicine. We pursue topics of bioethics both within the Rutgers community and at large in national debate competitions. We combine theoretical discussion with real-world applications to examine the moral considerations of a wide variety of topics and their implications in society. As an organization, we work to achieve an open environment for students looking to voice their opinions and tackle the ever challenging questions of bioethics.</p>

<p>We meet twice per month in Scott Hall (43 College Avenue, New Brunswick, NJ 08901). Find us on Facebook at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bioethics.ru">www.facebook.com/bioethics.ru</a>. You can also join our mailing list by contacting the administrator at <a href="mailto:rubioethics.soc@gmail.com">rubioethics.soc@gmail.com</a>. </p>
