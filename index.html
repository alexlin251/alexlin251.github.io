<p>Hello there! I am an undergraduate student at Rutgers University working towards a double major in Biological Sciences and Philosophy. I work as a Resident Assistant on the Busch campus and serve as a Co-President of the Rutgers Bioethics Society. In my spare time, I volunteer as an emergency medical technician for the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps. </p>

<p>When I am not dealing with residents, tackling ethical dilemmas, and medical emergencies, I enjoy playing the guitar, attending concerts, and exploring the road less traveled.  </p>

<p>As members of the Bioethics Society of Rutgers University, we hope to generate campus-wide awareness of some of the most current and pressing ethical issues in science and medicine. We pursue topics of bioethics both within the Rutgers community and at large in national debate competitions. We combine theoretical discussion with real-world applications to examine the moral considerations of a wide variety of topics and their implications in society. As an organization, we work to achieve an open environment for students looking to voice their opinions and tackle the ever challenging questions of bioethics.</p>

<p>We meet twice per month in Scott Hall (43 College Avenue, New Brunswick, NJ 08901). Find us on Facebook at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/bioethics.ru">www.facebook.com/bioethics.ru</a>. You can also join our mailing list by contacting the adminstrator at <a href="mailto:rubioethics.soc@gmail.com">rubioethics.soc@gmail.com</a>. </p>
